I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. I work at the [Ready Lab](https://readylab.mie.utoronto.ca/) under Dr. Alison Olechowski and I am also a graduate research fellow with the university's [Centre for Ethics, Ethics of AI lab](https://ethics.utoronto.ca/ethics-of-ai-in-context-eaic4e/) and the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/). My doctoral work is supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).

My research looks at how engineers are using new enterprise communication tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, and how we can use natural language processing tools and the mass amounts of data that are created every day to learn about engineering design. My recent work looked at how we can identify cycles of convergence and divergence within the engineering design process using Topic Modelling. Currently, I am analyzing Slack communication using a gender lens: what gendered communication patterns exist on these platforms, and do they impact how individuals are treated? Moving forward, I hope to investigate how these platforms help or hinder idea spread and innovation within engineering design teams. 

I also lead a project investigating student persistence in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, supported by the Ethics of AI lab at University of Toronto's Centre for Ethics. I will present the first part of this project at the American Society for Engineering Education Conference in June 2022, and you can see a summary of this work in [video form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBLuq3DTOGA) or [podcast form](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6Idcx23R2xSbHKRSwY7lXA?si=Yze4V9u8R6CqQaRVMRWViQ).

I also work as a research assistant under Dr. Anastasia Kuzminykh at the [COoKIE Group](https://www.cookiehci.com/) investigating explanations generated by large language models, and how these compare to human explanations.

I am passionate about increasing diversity in Engineering, and currently serve as the VP of Finance for the Graduate Society of Women Engineers.

I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto, and have work experience in the energy industry.
