I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. I work at the [Ready Lab](https://readylab.mie.utoronto.ca/) under Dr. Alison Olechowski and I am also a graduate research fellow with the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/). My doctoral work is supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). I was formerly a graduate research fellow at the university's [Centre for Ethics, Ethics of AI lab](https://ethics.utoronto.ca/ethics-of-ai-in-context-eaic4e/) from 2021-2022. This summer, I will intern as a Future of Work PhD Research Intern at Slack.

My research looks at how engineers are using new enterprise communication tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, and how we can use natural language processing tools and the mass amounts of digital trace data that are created every day to learn about engineering design. My recent work looked at how we can identify cycles of convergence and divergence within the engineering design process using Topic Modelling. I have analyzed Slack communication using a gender lens, investigating the gendered communication patterns and engagement on these platforms, which has recently been accepted to CSCW 2023. In the engineering design space, I have investigated how, why, and when conflict happens in design teams using these platforms, and under what circumstances does it lead to improved innovation. Moving forward, I hope to investigate how these platforms help or hinder idea spread and innovation within engineering design teams. 

I also work as a research assistant under Dr. Anastasia Kuzminykh at the [COoKIE Group](https://www.cookiehci.com/) investigating explanations generated by large language models, and how these compare to human explanations. We will present our work "Something Borrowed: Exploring the Influence of AI-Generated Explanation Text on the Composition of Human Explanations" at the CHI 2023 conference this year in Hamburg, Germany.

I also lead a project investigating student persistence in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, supported by the Ethics of AI lab at University of Toronto's Centre for Ethics. I presented the first part of this project at the American Society for Engineering Education Conference in June 2022, and you can see a summary of this work in [video form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBLuq3DTOGA) or [podcast form](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6Idcx23R2xSbHKRSwY7lXA?si=Yze4V9u8R6CqQaRVMRWViQ). 

I am passionate about increasing diversity in Engineering, and currently serve as the President of the Graduate Society of Women Engineers, after serving as the Vice President of Finance from 2021-2022.

I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto, and have work experience in the energy industry.
